# Troubleshooting and FAQ

[← Back to the README](../../../README.md)

Start with `/nexus doctor`: it checks the install, the fullscreen TUI, the pane width, the agents and the integrations.

### The dashboard doesn't appear.

Use the fullscreen TUI and type `/nexus`. `/nexus doctor` checks the setup. On narrow terminals, use `/nexus layout compact` or `minimal`.

### Why can't the pane get wider?

Claude Code caps a docked pane at 45% of the terminal and keeps at least 60 columns for the conversation. NEXUS asks for the maximum. A wider window or a smaller font gives it more room. If you once resized the pane by hand, Claude Code keeps that width over what a plugin asks for; `/nexus width` explains how to reset it.

### Why does an agent card say Sonnet instead of Haiku?

That's one of Claude Code's built-in agents (such as Explore), not one of your Haiku agents. NEXUS marks it *fallback* and shows the model it actually ran on.

### The dashboard looks different after 0.8 (or not different at all).

New installs open the **Orbit** theme. If you used NEXUS before 0.8 you stay on **Classic** with your old settings until you choose otherwise: `/nexus settings theme orbit` (or `classic` to go back). The pane reopens so its background follows the theme. To put every setting back to its default, `/nexus settings reset all`, then confirm with `/nexus settings reset all confirm`. If a saved settings file could not be read at start, NEXUS draws Classic for that session and writes nothing over your saved settings.

### `/nexus doctor` says the `test` agent definition is missing.

The Test agent is optional. Copy `skills/nexus/agents/nexus-test.md` to `~/.claude/agents/` (or install the companion skill). Without it everything else works as before. [How the Test agent is limited](test-agent.md).

### The black hole is not moving.

It moves only while the session is working, and not at all under reduced motion (`/nexus settings animation` is `reduced` or `off`, or Claude Code's own *reduce motion* is on). That is deliberate: nothing redraws while idle.

### The black hole shows boxes, or the dots look uneven.

The picture is drawn in Unicode Braille. If your terminal font has no Braille, or draws it at another width, use **Appearance → Art detail → Simple** (`/nexus settings artDetail simple`), which draws the same shapes with `'` `.` `:` `*`. `NO_COLOR` keeps the dots and removes the colour.

### Does NEXUS change my Claude Code settings?

No. Its preferences live in the plugin's own store, and modes apply to the current session only.

### Uninstall

```sh
claude plugin uninstall nexus@muhzain05
claude plugin marketplace remove muhzain05
```

If you stored a Jev key: `security delete-generic-password -s nexus-typesafe`.
