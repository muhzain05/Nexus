# The Test agent

[← Back to the README](../../../README.md)

`nexus-test` is the fourth Haiku role, next to Search, Grep and Audit. It runs the project's **existing** tests and reports what actually ran.

## What it is for

- Find the project's test command (the task, README, `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, CI config).
- Run the narrowest run that covers the change, then the suite if asked.
- Report in a fixed shape: `ran:` (exact commands), `result:` (`passed`, `failed` or `not run`), counts only when the output showed them, `failures:` (path, line, first error), and `not run:` (tests it *recommends* but did not execute, labelled as a recommendation).

NEXUS reads that report for the activity tape. A line like `test#1 failed · 2 failed, 40 passed` appears only if the agent printed those numbers; with no `result:` line the tape says `finished · no result line in its report`. A recommendation is never shown as a result.

## What NEXUS checks

NEXUS checks every tool call the Test agent makes, **on top of** Claude Code's own permissions (the engine still asks you as it always does; NEXUS never grants more than the lead already has):

| Rule | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| Only four tools | Read, Glob, Grep and Bash. Anything else (Write, Edit, web tools, MCP tools, Skill…) is refused. |
| Known test commands only | `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn test` and `run test[:name]`, `bun test`, `deno test`, `pytest`, `python -m pytest`/`unittest`, `go test`, `cargo test`/`nextest`, `swift test`, `dotnet test`, `mvn test`/`verify`, `gradle test`, `rspec`, `rake test`, `phpunit`, `jest`, `vitest run`, `mocha`, `ava`, `tap`, `make test`/`check`, `ctest`, `claude plugin test`, and `npx --no-install <runner>`. |
| One plain command | Plain ASCII only (a shell splits on a space or tab; anything else could be a different word to the shell than to NEXUS). No `&&`, `;`, pipes, redirects, substitution, globs, brackets or variables, and no `NAME=value` words. |
| An allowlist of flags per runner | A flag the runner is not listed as accepting is refused, because runners have flags that run code (`go test -toolexec`), write files (`-coverprofile`), load plugins or set the environment (`npm --node-options`). Values are type-checked: a number, a name from a short list, a plain test filter, or a path inside the repository. |
| Named targets only | `make`, `rake`, `gradle` and `mvn` accept only their test target; `make test install` is refused. |
| No silent installs | No `install`, `add`, `ci`, `pip install`, or `npx` without `--no-install`. |
| No rewriting | No snapshot-update, `--fix`, `--write` or output-file flags; no watch mode. |
| Inside the repository | No absolute paths, `..`, URLs or package specifiers, and nothing that looks like a secret file. Every path argument is also resolved through symlinks and must stay inside the repository; a file that does not exist yet is judged by its nearest existing parent folder, and if NEXUS cannot tell where a path leads the call is refused. |
| Foreground, with a timeout | Always foreground; the timeout is the agent's own but never over 5 minutes (2 by default). |
| Sandbox and permission fields dropped | Any field of the call that loosens a sandbox or permission, or claims an approval (`permissionMode`, `allowedTools`, `approved`, …), is removed before the call reaches the engine. What the task or the agent says is never read by the gate. |
| Fails closed | If NEXUS cannot decide, the call is refused. |

**Settings → Agents → Run tests** switches it off (`/nexus settings testRunner off`): every Bash call from the Test agent is then refused, while reads still work. The default is *known test commands*. Upgrading never loosens it.

A refusal is shown on the activity tape with the reason, and the agent is told to report it as `not run`.

## What it is not

- **It is not isolation.** A test command runs the project's own test code with your permissions, so that code can do anything you can. The checks above limit what the *agent can ask for*; they do not sandbox what your tests do once started.
- Build tools may fetch the project's own declared dependencies when they run (`cargo test`, `go test`, `mvn test`). NEXUS does not stop that.
- Other agents (including Claude Code's built-in ones) and the lead itself are not checked by this gate; their Bash calls go through your normal permission rules.
- It overlaps `nexus-audit`, which also runs the project's tests, and it has **not been benchmarked**. The [benchmark](haiku-agents-benchmark.md) that picked the other roles did not test it, and Claude Code decides when to delegate to it.

## Install

The agent definition is [`skills/nexus/agents/nexus-test.md`](../../../skills/nexus/agents/nexus-test.md). Copy it next to the others in `~/.claude/agents/` (or `.claude/agents/` for one project), or install the companion skill and let it do that. Without the definition the dashboard works as before, and `/nexus doctor` says `test missing`.

## How it was checked

The command gate was reviewed by the NEXUS Council (security, architecture and performance reviewers) twice.

- **0.8.0, first checkpoint.** The first version blocked flags one by one and was bypassed (`go test -toolexec`, `npm --node-options`, `mvn exec:exec`, `make test install`, quoted shell syntax, URLs, and more). It was replaced with the per-runner allowlist above, and every reported bypass became a refusal test (`mod/nexus/tests/testrunner.test.ts`). That replacement was not re-reviewed at the time.
- **0.8.1.** A fresh adversarial pass added tests for alternate executables and wrappers, look-alike and invisible characters, quoting tricks, repeated and reordered flags, environment words in every position, and an agent told it may run anything. It found two real gaps, both fixed: a not-yet-existing file under a symlinked folder, and a tokenizer that split on more whitespace than a shell does. All three Council reviewers then reviewed the final code (see the pull request for their findings and what was done).

A passing test is not a proof; an allowlist is not a sandbox. If you find a command that passes and should not, please report it privately: see [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md).
