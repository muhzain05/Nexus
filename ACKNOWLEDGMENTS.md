## Cache Guard and Cachebeat

Cache Guard draws inspiration from [Cachebeat](https://github.com/ARahim3/cachebeat), created by [Abdur Rahim (@ARahim3)](https://github.com/ARahim3). Cachebeat is MIT-licensed (Copyright (c) 2026 Abdur Rahim).

Cache Guard was written independently for NEXUS. **No Cachebeat code is reused**, so no third-party licence text is bundled. If any Cachebeat code is ever ported, its MIT notice will be added in a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` file.

This acknowledgment does not imply that the Cachebeat author endorses NEXUS.

| | Origin |
|---|---|
| Beat only after N minutes of true inactivity, N under the cache lifetime (default 50) | Cachebeat's design |
| An auto-stop deadline for abandoned sessions (default 8 hours) | Cachebeat's design |
| Stand down when idle time already exceeds the cache lifetime (the cache is cold) | Cachebeat's design |
| Judge a beat by its own usage: cold when it wrote more cache than it read | Cachebeat's design |
| Beats as `$.model.fork` calls (no turn, no transcript entry, tools denied, invisible to plugin hooks) | NEXUS |
| Beat-count and API-estimate budgets, checked before a beat that would pass them | NEXUS |
| Cache-lifetime evidence (subagent 1-hour writes, a cache that held over real idle time, beats) | NEXUS |
| States OFF / ARMED / REFRESHING / WARM / EXPIRED / PAUSED / ERROR and the dashboard module | NEXUS |
| Holding beats while agents run or a permission dialog waits; reload and session-end handling | NEXUS |

Cachebeat runs as a skill with a background `Stop` hook (`asyncRewake`) that wakes the main model. Each beat is a real turn answered with ".". NEXUS uses a model fork instead, so beats don't enter the transcript and never pass through Swarm's own model-routing, escalation, Jev or advisor hooks.

## NEXUS Council and tool routing

[NEXUS Council](mod/nexus/docs/council-and-tool-routing.md) is inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council): independent model reviews, then a synthesis. NEXUS adapts the idea to software-engineering review inside Claude Code. It uses its own Security, Architecture and Performance reviewers, Off / Adaptive / On activation with the advisor choosing in Adaptive, a gated, read-only launch, and a merge with no extra chairman model. **No LLM Council code is used.** Its licence would be checked before any code was ported.

Dr. [Tian Tian](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/engineering/faculty-staff/academic-staff/tian-tian.html) suggested several ideas in research discussions:
- minimal initial agent toolsets;
- dynamic tool and model routing;
- small fine-tuned decision models;
- longer-running autonomous metadynamics workflows.

He also shared the [pi-pocket](https://github.com/alchem0x2A/pi-pocket) harness as a reference. These ideas shaped Council's least-privilege reviewer tools, the deterministic router and its narrow-only extension point for a future decision model. This doesn't imply his endorsement of NEXUS, and no scientific workflow is part of NEXUS.

## Orbit

The Orbit theme's restrained, terminal-native look is inspired by [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org)'s aesthetic, and the Sonnet black hole follows the way the black hole in the film *Interstellar* is usually drawn: a dark horizon, a bright accretion disk and light bent over and under it. NEXUS takes ideas only. **No code, image, font or other asset from either is used.**

The black hole is **drawn by hand in code** (`mod/nexus/hooks/blackhole.ts`, `bhscene.ts`, `bhsample.ts`): its shapes are formulas composed by eye against an amber halftone reference image supplied to the project, and no pixel, colour value or file from that image is copied or embedded. (One rejected experiment sampled the reference to compare it with the hand-drawn curves; it was never part of the code, and no comparison image containing the reference is committed.) The reference image's own origin is not known to this project, so it is not redistributed anywhere in this repository. This acknowledgment does not imply endorsement by Omarchy or anyone involved in the film.
